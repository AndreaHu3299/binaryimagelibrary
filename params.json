{"name":"Binaryimagelibrary","tagline":"Portable library for binary (bi-valued) image processing","body":"### Welcome to the Binary Image Library\r\n\r\nThis is a library for manipulating binary (i.e. bi-valued) images. Anything that is to do with binary\r\nimages belongs here. The code is pure portable ANSI C, with no dependencies other than the standard\r\nlibrary. The idea is it should run pretty much anywhere with no problems.\r\n\r\nA binary image is the simplest sort of image you can create, but they still throw up interesting\r\nprogramming problems. Whilst some binary images, like faxes, are designed for direct human viewing,\r\ngenerally you will only display a binary image directly on low-end hardware. However many problems\r\nin image recognition involve binary images as an intermediate step. Binary images also crop up \r\nin path finding problems, curve fitting for vectorisation, and as a step in a basic font rendering.\r\n\r\nThe website for the project is hosted at \r\n\r\n[http://www.malcolmmclean.site11.com/www](http://www.malcolmmclean.site11.com/www)\r\n\r\nunfortunately the big software companies seem to be blacklisting that site, so you often get spurious\r\nwarnings.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
