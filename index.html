<p>This is a library for manipulating binary (i.e. bi-valued) images. Anything that is to do with binary
images belongs here. The code is pure portable ANSI C, with no dependencies other than the standard
library. The idea is it should run pretty much anywhere with no problems.</p>

<p>A binary image is the simplest sort of image you can create, but they still throw up interesting
programming problems. Whilst some binary images, like faxes, are designed for direct human viewing,
generally you will only display a binary image directly on low-end hardware. However many problems
in image recognition involve binary images as an intermediate step. Binary images also crop up 
in path finding problems, curve fitting for vectorisation, and as a step in a basic font rendering.</p>

<p>The website for the project is hosted at </p>

<p>unfortunately the big software companies seem to be blacklisting that site, so you often get spurious
warnings.</p>
