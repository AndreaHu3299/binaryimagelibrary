<h1> Discrete Voronoi function </h1>
From the Binary Image Processing Library <A href = "../index.html">homepage</A>.
<P>
A Voronoi diagram shows a scattered of points in a plane, with
each point assigned its own region. The region is defined as
the zone where the point is the closest point to an observer
on the plane.

It's a natural divsion of space, and Voronoi diagrams have 
may uses. However they are rather tricky to calculate. The
discrete Voronoi function calculate Voronoi regions over a
binary image.

<P>
The seeds are passed in in an integer array, with the
background set to -1. Normally each seed will have a 
unique integer values, though this is not essential. We
then represent the seeds as a binary image, and do a 
distance transform. We then sort all the pixels by value,
and, starting from the closest, fill them to the value of
the nearest neighbour.

It doesn't produce perfect results because of edge effects
and discretisaton problems. But it gives a pretty good 
approximation to the Voronoi diagram, and much easier than
floating-point based methods.
