<H1> Binary Hausdorff Distance </H1>
From the Binary Image Library <A href = "../index.html"> homepage </A>
<P>
Hausdorff distance is the distance from the furthest point on 
one island (or coast) to the nearest point on the other
island, or vice versa. So it is the maximum distance you
must travel if placed in any position on one island and
ask to get to the other. The half Hausdorff distance is the
same measure, but with the restriction that you must be on island A and hoping to trave to isalnd B, or vice versa. 
Hausdorff distance is simply the maximum of the two half
Hausdorff distances.
</P>
<P>
If we relax the requirement for two physical islands and
allow them to overlap in space, Hausdorff distance becomes
quite a good measure of similarity. Two identical shapes 
will have a Hausdorff distance of zero. However all the
weight is onthe outlier, on the most distant point contributes
to Hausdorff distance.

Here are two binary images, a Latin A and a Nordic A-ring. 
The images are substantially similar, except for the small
decoraton on top.
</P>
<P>
To calculate the Hausdorff distance discretely, we repeatedly
dilate the image with a 3x3 all set structuring element,
until all pixels in the other image (original) are covered. 
The number of dilations gives us the half-Hausdorff distance.
We then repeat the process with the other image to obtain
the other half-Hausdorff distance. This method weights
diagonal and straight moves equally.

Pixels not in the other set are green. The half-Hausdorff
distance A to B is three, B to A is one. So A is very nearly
a superset of B, just one pixel on the border in B but not
in A. However the half-Hausdorff distance of 3 for such a
small image doesn't tell you much about what type of 
superset A is. In fact the images are nearly identical apart
from the ring, but almost any image that would fit on the
grid would have a half-Hausdorff distance of three or four.
Use the function in reality for relatively large, compact
shapes.
