<H1> A* Path-Finding Algorthm </H1>
From the Binary Image Library <A href = "../index.html"> homepage </A>
<P>
A star (A*) is a path-finding algorithm that finds a short
path between two objects. For binary images, we assume that
unset pixels are walls and inaccessible whilst set
pixels are clear and all have the same cost of movement. You
can modify the function to have variable cost of movement
dependent on terrain type, but then it is no longer a binary
image algorithm.
</P>
<P>
It works by expanding two search balloons round A and B. When
the balloons meet, we have found a path - not necessarily the
shortest path, but a short path. We tag the points in the
ballons with a cost, and keep them in a priority queue. At
each step, we take the lowest cost item from the queue, search
for unset and unvisited pixels round it, and add to the queue.
</P>
<P>
If we make cost a strict distance from the start / end points,
the search is a brute force shortest path through a graph
problem. The "star" comes in because, if the number of walls
is not ridiculously high, the shortest path will likely be
roughly a straight line between A and B. So we expand the
balloons preferably in that general direction, and only start
looking at convoluted paths when we cannot find a direct one. 
</P>
<P>
So each point has a cost (the cost of travel from A or B to 
the endpoint) and a heuristic, which is the diagonal distance
to the target. Diagonal distance is the distance assuming
steps are restricted to straight steps or one-pixel diagonal
steps, but disallowing knight's move or higher steps. We
weight the cost and the heuristic equally when putting points
in the priority queue.
</P>
<P>
To allow efficient traceback we tag each visited pixel with 
the ballon from which it was was visited, and the direction
back to the home point. Then it is necessary to reverse to
reconstruct the path. 
</P>

<P>
Here's how it did on a simple test problem. The path is pretty
reasonable.
