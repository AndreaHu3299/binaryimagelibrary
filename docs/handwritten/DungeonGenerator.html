<H1> Dungeon Generator </H1>
From the Binary Image Library <A href = "../index.html"> homepage </A>
<P>
Dungeon generation is an important part of games design. Some
games require dungeons to be created on the fly, other games
designers use automatic generation to speed up their work.
</P>
<P>
Currently the generator is a straight port of Bob Nystrom's work
<A href = "http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/12/21/rooms-and-mazes/"> here </A> and it's got a very simple interface, just:
<pre class = "prettyprint">
int width = 200;
int height = 100;
unsigned char *dungeon = makedungeon(width, height);
</pre>

Very nice.

<H2> Cavern generator </H2>
<P>
For cavern levels, a generator based on square rooms and corridors is no good. So we have a separate cavern generator.
</P>
<P>
It works on the cellular automaton principle. We start off
with all the tiles set to random, except for the borders 
which are hard-coded to walls. Then we majority filter several
times. This creates coherent regions of cavern and wall. 
</P>
<P>
The cavern regions are not connected, so we label the separate regions, then for each one, take the point closest to the
centre. The we draw a slighly jagged corridor from cavern to centre until we hit another cavern. This is almost but not
quite guaranteed to connect all our caverns. So as a last step
we eliminate any unconnected caverns and break any 8-connections in the background we might have introduced.
</P>
<P>
Note that you can modify the function slightly to retain the 
labels. That might be useful if you want a notion of caverns as rooms or separate encounter areas.

Not too bad.
