<H1> Dungeon Generator </H1>
From the Binary Image Library <A href = "../index.html"> homepage </A>
<P>
Dungeon generation is an important part of games design. Some
games require dungeons to be created on the fly, other games
designers use automatic generation to speed up their work.
</P>
<P>
Currently the generator is a straight port of Bob Nystrom's work
<A href = "http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/12/21/rooms-and-mazes/"> here </A> and it's got a very simple interface, just:
<pre class = "prettyprint">
int width = 200;
int height = 100;
unsigned char *dungeon = makedungeon(width, height);
</pre>
