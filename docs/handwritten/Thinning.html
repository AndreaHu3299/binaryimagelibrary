<H1> Binary Image Thinning </H1>
From the Binary Image Library <A href = "../index.html"> homepage </A>
<P>
Thinning is the process of progressively getting rid of
edge pixels until only the skeleton remains. Lines one pixel
wide are the result. Whilst thinning is in fact a pure 3x3
neighbourhood operation, it is subtly difficult to get right, especially for an in-place algorithm. None of the connections
must be broken, and lines two pixels thick must be thinned 
correctly.
</P>

<P>
A stylised drawing of a man was chosen as the test image.
When he was thinned, this was the result.

<P>
The loops look wrong. In fact they are correct, when you
zoom in on the original image, you see a couple of places
where there are isolated unset pixels in inner corners. 
Since these are techncially holes, they must be preserved, 
and the loops are the result.
</P>
<P>
To fix up that problem I did a morphological close operation
with a 3x3 structuring element to get rid of one pixel-wide
holes. The resulting image is visually unchanged, but when we thin, the loops are gone.
